This JavaScript file appears to be a utility script used for handling pull requests and forks in a Github repository.

File: `pullForkUtil.js`

1. **Dependencies**: This script uses several Node.js packages, including `simple-git` for executing git commands, `crypto-js/sha256` for generating SHA-256 checksums, `fs` for file system interactions, `tar` for creating tarball archives, `child_process` for executing shell commands, and two locally defined utilities, `gitHubUtil` and `gitHeadUtil`.

2. **Functions**:

    - `execute(command)`: Executes a shell command and returns a promise that resolves with the command's output or rejects with an error.
    
    - `getSha256Fork(baseDir, fork)`: Generates a SHA-256 checksum for a particular fork repository.
    
    -  `tarRepo(baseDir, fork)`: Archives a fork repository location using the `tar` command.
    
    -  `pullForkUtil(repo, forkOid, url, branch)`: Attempts to initialize a Git repository at a specific location (based on a repository name and fork object ID), adds a remote URL, fetches data from that URL, switches to a specific branch, deletes the `.git` directory, archives the repository, and calculates a SHA-256 checksum for the archive.
    
    -  `getPullRequestSha256(repo, fork, branch)`: Placeholder function for SHA-256 checksum related to a pull request.
    
    -  `getPRhead(args)`: Retrieves PR head related information based on owner, repo, and the defaultHash from the provided arguments.

3. **Module Export**: The utility script exports the `pullForkUtil` object, which includes the associated functions.
