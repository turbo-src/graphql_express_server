`gitHeadUtil.js`

This file provides utility for handling Git operations primarily regarding GitHub repositories. It exports an asynchronous function within an object called `gitHeadUtil`. This function fetches details concerning commits from the specified repository. 

The function `gitHeadUtil` takes in four parameters:

- `owner` : The username of the repository's owner
- `repo` : The name of the repository
- `forkBranch` : The name of the forked branch. The default branches are 'master' or empty string (`''`)
- `headMinusNum` : The index to select a particular commit id from the list. 

In order to authenticate the requests, the function gets a GitHub Token through the `getGithubToken` method from `gitHubUtil` file and verifies it using JSON Web Token (JWT).

If there is an error during the operation, and the GitHub API returns a 404 status, the function will return a 404 as the result. Otherwise, it will throw the error. If the request is successful, the function will return the commit id (`head`) of the specified repository. 

The module uses Octokit, a GitHub REST API client for JavaScript, to perform requests. Filesystem (`fs`) and `dotenv` packages are used for access to file system and environment variables respectively.

Note that commit details logic implementation depends on the branch name. When the branch name is 'master' or an empty string, the function requests information about all commits. For any other branch name, it requests specific information regarding the specified branch.
