Based on the provided JavaScript file, the following descriptions can be made about the/some focused functionalities:

## File: engineRequests.js
This file implements a series of utility functions for making API requests to an external service. It uses Node.js 'superagent' module for HTTP requests and 'getServiceEndpoint' utility function from the local 'config' module to retrieve corresponding service endpoints based on environment. The functions cover a wide range of operations for processing general tasks for a user's repository like getting repo data, creating user and repository, managing pull requests, etc.

Here are descriptions of some of the functions:

- `postCreateUser`: This function allows creation of a user on an offchain service.

- `postCreateRepo`: This function allows creation of a repository.

- `postCreatePullRequest`: This function facilitates creation of pull requests.

- `createLinkedPullRequest`: This function allows creation of linked pull requests.

- `getRepoStatus`: This function fetches the current status of a given repository.

- `postTransferTokens`: This method facilitates transferring tokens between users in a designated repository.

- `postGetContributorName`, `postGetContributorID`, `postGetContributorSignature`: These functions fetch data of a contributor such as their name, id, and signatures.

All functions get the offchain service endpoint from the config file. They send a POST request to this endpoint with appropriate GraphQL query in JSON format and then parse the response to return the expected data. The end functionality will depend on the structure of the GraphQL API.
