This JavaScript file, `ghServiceRequests.js`, houses utility functions related to the GitHub service. It resides in the `utils` folder within `turbosrc-service` inside the `src` directory. Here's a summary of the essential functions defined within:

1. **postCreateIssue:** This asynchronous function takes in three parameters: 'repo' (repository), 'issue_id' (GitHub's issue ID), and 'tsrc_id' (Turbosrc's ID). It makes a POST request to a service endpoint (obtained from the 'getServiceEndpoint' method of a configuration module) and sends along a query that requests the creation of a GitHub issue. The request payload contains these ID parameters. On response, it parses the result to JSON format and returns the created issue's information.

2. **postGetIssueID:** Similar to 'postCreateIssue', this function retrieves a GitHub issue ID from the service. It takes a repository and a Turbosrc ID as parameters, sends the POST request with an associated query, and returns the result after parsing it to JSON format.

3. **postGetTsrcID:** This function retrieves a Turbosrc ID, given a repository and a GitHub issue ID. It works similarly to 'postGetIssueID', using a POST request and returning parsed JSON data.

The module uses the `superagent` library for handling HTTP requests and `getServiceEndpoint` method from the `config` module to get the appropriate endpoint for the service. The processed JSON data provides `status`, `tsrcID`, `issueID`, and `message` from the responses obtained.
