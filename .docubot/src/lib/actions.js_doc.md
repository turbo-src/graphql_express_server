This JavaScript file, `actions.js`, appears to be a part of a backend service interacting with GitHub's API, and generating and handling pull requests. The file includes a set of utility/helper functions, each having a distinct role.

Key functions:

1. `convertIssueID` - Converts issue identifiers into `tsrcID`, updates `defaultHash` and `childDefaultHash`.
2. `createTsrcPullRequest` - Supports creating a pull request.
3. `getPRvote` - Fetches the voting status of a Pull Request (PR).
4. `getPRvoteYesTotals` - Fetches the total 'yes' votes for a PR.
5. `getVotes` & `getRepoData` - Fetches vote and repository data respectively. 
6. `getPRvoteNoTotals` - Fetches the total 'no' votes for a PR.
7. `getVotePowerAmount` - Fetches the voting power amount of a contributor.
8. `pullAndVoteStatus` - Decides whether a PR and vote status should be updated.
9. `setVote` - Creates a vote on the PR.
10. `updatePullRequest` - Updates the PR status based on user votes.
11. `transferTokens` - Transfers tokens between users.
12. `createUser` & `getUser` - Creates a new user and fetches user details respectively.
13. `getContributorName` & `getContributorID` & `getContributorSignature` - Fetches respective contributor details.
14. `createRepo` - Creates a new GitHub repository.
15. `newPullRequest` - Creates a new pull request on GitHub.
16. `getActivePullRequestsCount` - Counts the number of active pull requests.
17. `getRepoStatus` & `getAuthorizedContributor` - Fetches the repository status and checks if a contributor is authorized respectively.
18. `getTurboSrcIDfromInstance` - Fetches the Turbo Src ID from instance. 

Each method appears to interact with multiple external API endpoints such as the GitHub Pull Request and Issue APIs and other internal utilities. This file is likely part of an application that facilitates code collaboration and version control, possibly providing additional layers of control, permissions, and functionality than standard Git.
