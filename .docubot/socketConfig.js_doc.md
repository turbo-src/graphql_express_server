File: `/app/filebot-store-000/turbosrc-service/socketConfig.js`

This JavaScript file sets up and configures a Socket.IO client. The client connects to a server running at `http://turbosrc-egress-router:4007/` using the websocket transport. This connection utilizes a custom path `/vote-client/socket.io` and includes a custom header `my-custom-header` with value `abcd` in the transport polling options.
  
Additionally, the created socket will log its ID whenever it connects or loses connection to the server. The socket connection does not enforce secure protocols. The created and configured socket is then exported for use in other modules. The file uses `socket.io-client` package for managing the creation and configuration of the socket.
