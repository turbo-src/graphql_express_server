**File: pullForkServer.js**

This JavaScript file located at `/app/filebot-store-000/turbosrc-service/pullForkServer.js` implements an Express server that uses GraphQL and CORS to handle requests related to pull requests and fetching respective fork information from the GitHub repositories.

**Key functionality:**

1. The server is initialized with Express, GraphQL, CORS and some utility modules for pull request and git repository operations (`pullForkUtil`, `getPullRequest`, `gitHeadUtil`).

2. A GraphQL schema and root resolver are defined. In particular, it can serve a `getPRfork` query that accepts `owner`, `repo`, `defaultHash`, `contributor_id` fields and returns a `String`.

3. The `getPRfork` function takes arguments related to a repo owner, repo name, default hash and contributor ID. It uses defined utility functions (`getPullRequest` and `gitHeadUtil`) to fetch pull request and git head information. The pull request fork info, including the base repo's branch, fork branch and the repository URL from where the codebase was forked, is obtained using `pullForkUtil`. It returns a 'repoHash'.

4. Defines a middleware function that overrides the `res.send` method to log the outgoing messages.

5. it uses the GraphQL middleware with settings to interact with the server through the `graphqlHTTP` function.

6. Listens for incoming connections on port 4001 and allows you to interact with the GraphQL API via the route localhost:4001/graphql.

The file follows the modern self-invoking async function pattern for better error handling and to handle asynchronous operations in a top-level scope seamlessly. It also tries to optimize the usage of the GitHub API by passing most of the required data in the request.
