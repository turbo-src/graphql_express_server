# Summary

`preTestCreatePRs.js`:
This javascript file is part of the test suite for an application that interacts with GitHub. It contains tests for creating repositories and GitHub pull requests.

The file imports modules for assertions (`assert`), file system promises (`fs.promises`), HTTP-based requests (`requests`), and parsing GraphQL (`graphql/language/parser`). It uses Mocha's `describe` and `it` blocks to structure the tests. 

Functions:

- The `snooze` function pauses execution for a given number of milliseconds.
- `readDBfile` reads a file and handles any errors.
- `getGithubUser` reads the GitHub username from a configuration file and throws an error if it cannot be found.

Test Cases:

- Tests are wrapped in a parent `describe` block with the description 'Create repo and GH pull request'. 
- The time limit for these tests is extended by Mocha's `this.timeout` feature. 
- A nested `describe.only` block runs a series of tests checking that the 'db server and deprecated server output is the same'.
- These tests read data from various `json` files and compare the contents using `assert.equal`. The tests are validating that data matches between the test database and a deprecated database for creating a repo, creating token supply, setting head commit, and setting quorum respectively. For setting head commit, it compares a specific username's data.
- If the outputs are the same, the test passes; otherwise, the test fails. In the case of fetching Github user, if the user is not found, it throws an error.
