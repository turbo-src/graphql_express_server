**File**: getContributorTokenAmount.js

**Location**: /app/filebot-store-000/turbosrc-service/testing/integration/privaterepo

**Description**: 

This JavaScript file is a test case of a voting system using the Mocha testing framework. Specifically, it tests the functionality meant to prevent duplicate votes by a minority voter in a GitHub repository.

The main functions of this script are:

- **postCreateRepo, postSetVote, postNewPullRequest, postGetVotePowerAmount, postGetContributorID, postGetContributorName**: These are helper functions imported from '../../../src/utils/requests' for making various GitHub repository related requests.

- **getContributorAddress, getGithubContributor**: These are helper functions imported from '../../../src/utils/config' for getting contributor details.

- **snooze**: Function used to prevent duplication errors by delaying a specific amount of milliseconds before each test.

In this test case, it retrieves the specific voting power amount of a contributor on a 'demo' repository and asserts that it reflects the expected value (status: 200, amount: 500001). If it doesn't, it will throw a "Fail to get token amount" error message. 

This script is critical for ensuring the robustness of the voting functionality of the application.
