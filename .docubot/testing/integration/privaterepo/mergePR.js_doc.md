**Description:** 

This JavaScript file is a test file for merging pull requests in a private repository. It is part of an integration testing suite for the 'turbosrc-service' application. 

**Important Functions:** 

1. `postSetVote`: A utility function for setting votes.
2. `postGetPullRequest`: A utility function to get pull request.
3. `postGetPRvoteYesTotals`, `postGetPRvoteNoTotals`: Utility functions to get total votes (supporting and not-supporting) for a pull request.
4. `postCreateRepo`, `postNewPullRequest`, `postClosePullRequest`, `postMergePullRequest`: Utility functions for repository and pull request management.
5. `postGetContributorID`, `postGetContributorName`: Utility functions to get contributor details.
6. `getContributorAddress`, `getGithubContributor`: Utility functions to get details of an individual contributor.

The file has a Mocha test case 'Merge pull request.' that tests if a pull request can be merged. This test will fail if the request is not successfully merged. The test includes a delay (snooze) function to avoid data duplication issues during the test run. The test also uses assertions to validate the outcome of the test.
