**File: voteAfterMerge.js**

This file is a Node.js script that contains integration tests for a specific scenario related to voting and merging pull requests in a repository platform. 

- First, it imports the required packages and utility functions from different modules. This includes `assert` for making assertions, `fsPromises` for handling file system promises, and `graphql/language/parser` for parsing GraphQL language. 
- It also contains various utilities (`postSetVote`, `postGetPullRequest`, etc.) for making specific request calls related to pull requests and voting process. 
- `getContributorAddress` and `getGithubContributor` functions are used to retrieve the contributor address and Github Contributor respectively. 

Test Scenario:
- The script tests a scenario where two voters vote on a pull request, resulting in a merge due to exceeding the quorum. The main test sequence involves:
    - Getting the Github contributor name.
    - Getting the contributor ID.
    - Checking the merging status of the pull request.
    - Checking the final vote totals.
    - Trying to cast a vote after the merging process (which should return an error).
    - Finally, it checks the merging status again and verifies the total votes after the merge process.

- Assertions are made at every step in the test to ensure the right outcomes.
- `snooze` function is used to pause execution of tests for a specified time period (in milliseconds), this allows for asynchronous actions to complete.  

This script can be useful for validating the voting and merging functions within a repository platform.
