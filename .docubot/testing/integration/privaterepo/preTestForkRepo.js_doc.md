**preTestForkRepo.js File Documentation**

This JavaScript file, located at */app/filebot-store-000/turbosrc-service/testing/integration/privaterepo/preTestForkRepo.js*, specifically pertains to testing the creation of a repository and a GitHub pull request. It utilizes the Mocha testing framework and node.js promises to perform asynchronous operations.

**Functionality**

- The script reads a `.config.json` file to retrieve and validate GitHub organization data.
- The script initiates a ‘Fork’ request using the postFork() function from the requests utility, using the GitHub organization retrieved as the owner, repo, and org parameters.
- It incorporates a 'snooze' function to prevent duplication errors in the tests. This is a delay mechanism put into place to prevent data races which can occur when multiple threads access shared data simultaneously.
- Assertion is used to validate the forking process and throws an error message "Fail to fork" if the assertion fails.

**Module Dependencies**

- `assert` module: Utilized for validation.
- `fs` module with ‘Promises’: To read files asynchronously.
- `requests` module: To request the creation, forking, and pull requests of repositories.
- `graphql`’s `Parser` module: Seemingly unused but likely utilized in other parts of the code not visible in this file.

**Testing Procedures**

- The script handles testing cases under the description 'Create a repo and GitHub pull request'.
- It also contains a specific testing case under the titled 'Check status after creating a repo' where it reads the GitHub organization from the `.config.json` file and initiates a fork. It then uses an assert function to check that the process was successful.
