File: `getGitHubPullRequest.js`

This JavaScript file tests the `getGitHubPullRequest` function located in the `/src/utils/requests` directory. 

Dependencies: The script imports functionality from assertion libraries, filesystem handling, GraphQL Parser, and other utility functions including repo creation, GitHub pull requests, and contributor details.

The script then sets a constant `snooze_ms` that will be used to ensure no data race conditions arise by imposing a delay before each test case.

The test suite is named 'Pull request' has a setup block that sets no preliminary steps before tests. 

Test Setup: The script begins by defining a test case that should succeed if a pull request is successfully fetched using the `getGitHubPullRequest` function. The test increases the default Mocha testing framework's timeout to avoid test failures due to timeouts. 

Test Details: The test should fetch pull request 1 from a sample repo, denoted as "demo" with owner "7db9a". The fetching function requires the contributor's name, which it gets by calling `getGithubContributor`.

Assertions: 
1. Confirming that the pull request is marked as mergeable.
2. Verifying that the state of the pull request is "open".
3. Checking the pull request's merge commit SHA matches the expected value.
4. Confirming that the base branch is "master".

This module forms part of an automated testing system to validate the functionality of a system that interacts with GitHub pull requests.
