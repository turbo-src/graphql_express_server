**Filename:** preTestCreatePRs.js

**Location:** /app/filebot-store-000/turbosrc-service/testing/integration/privaterepo/

**Functionality:**

This file is a test script designed to create multiple pull requests in a GitHub repository for integration tests. 

**Details:**

- Initially, it imports necessary dependencies such as the 'assert' package for assertion, 'fs' for file system operations and various functions like 'postCreateRepo', 'postSetVote', 'getGithubContributor' etc. from different utility modules.
- It defines a 'snooze' function that operates as a delay mechanism that's used between test steps.
- It includes a single Mocha test suite titled 'Create repo and GH pull request', within which just a single test case is present.
- This case retrieves the Github contributor's name and then creates six pull requests on the "demo" repository under the current contributor's ownership.
- Each pull request is given a different branch and issue identification string, as well as a distinct title for clarity.
- The assert at the end verifies whether the pull requests are created successfully or not.

**Usage:**

This script needs to be executed in a JavaScript runtime environment preferably with Mocha installed, as it is a Mocha test file. As the test cases involve interaction with GitHub, valid contributor identification and appropriate repository permissions are required.
