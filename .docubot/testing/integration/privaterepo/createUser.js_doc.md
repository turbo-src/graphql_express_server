Title: Test Suite for User Creation and Contributor Name Fetching Functionality

Description: 

This JavaScript file contains a testing suite written in Mocha for testing user creation and contributor name fetching functionality. The two major aspects covered in the test cases are:

1. Creation of Users:
The 'before' section prepares by creating multiple user entries using the 'postCreateUser' function. User information includes details like the Contributor ID, Contributor Name, Contributor Signature, and a GitHub Token for each created account. It creates 12 different testers for the purpose of the test.

2. Fetching Contributor Names:
The testing suite also includes a 'Get Contributor Name' test case. This test case fetches different contributor names using the 'postGetContributorName' function; then compares the fetched result with the expected result using assert equals.

The following additional functionalities are used:

- snooze(): To prevent duplication errors that may be caused due to data races.
- getGithubContributor(): Fetches GitHub contributor details.
- getGithubToken(): Fetches GitHub token required for authentication. 
- postGetContribitorID(): Fetches contributor ID.
  
Dependencies: The code requires 'assert' for validating test case results and 'fs' for managing file system related operations. It also utilises other utility functions from several other files located in the 'src/utils' directory for requester, config and GitHub related operations.
