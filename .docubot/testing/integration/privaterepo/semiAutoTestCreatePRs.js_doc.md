#### Summary:

This file is an integration test file for creating a GitHub repository and a pull request. It uses Mocha as its testing framework. The test is designed to automatically create a pull request in a specific repository in a GitHub account.

#### Description of Operations:

- `require()`: Import necessary modules.
- `var snooze_ms = 1500;`: Define a sleep time between operations to avoid data race conditions.
- `snooze()`: Promise function to wait for defined sleep time before execution.
- `describe`: Test suite begins, where the GitHub actions are described and tested.
   - `before()`: A hook function that performs operations before the test starts. Currently, it does nothing.
   - `describe.only()`: Define a sub-test suite to evaluate the status when a new repository is created. Only this test suite will be run.
    - `it()`: It sets up a single test to create a pull request on a demo repository on GitHub.

In the test:
- The GitHub contributor's name is retrieved.
- A pause operation is performed to avoid possible duplication errors.
- A pull request is created in a repository named "demo" using the `postCreatePullRequest()` function.
- An assertion is invoked to confirm everything worked as expected. 

NOTE: Some areas in this file suggest that it may be under development or updating, and it may not function as intended.
