This JavaScript file appears to be a test script for managing pull requests within a GitHub-like repository. Below is a brief documentation:

- Filename: openPRs.js
- Location: /app/filebot-store-000/turbosrc-service/testing/integration/vim
- Description: The script tests functionality related to open pull requests. Specifically, it examines the behavior of system when encountering duplicate pull requests and attempts to reopen a closed pull request.
- Imported modules: assert for validating test conditions, and a collection of methods from the requests module that simulate interactions with the tested system.
- Additional imports: Parser from the 'graphql/language/parser' library for handling GraphQL queries.
- The script uses describe blocks to group similar test cases and it keyword from Mocha to specify each individual test.
- In this particular script, there are two main test cases:
    1. Testing the system's ability to handle duplicate pull requests in the "Duplicate pull request" describe block.
    2. Testing whether a closed pull request can be reopened in the "Should not allow reopening a closed pull request" test case.
- The 'snooze' function is used to pause the test execution for a specified time (e.g., this might help prevent duplication errors/data races).
- The 'before' clause sets up a repository and a pull request for testing purpose before the actual test execution begins.
- Constants are declared as placeholders for required arguments in the functions invoked during the test execution.

Please note that some parts of the test cases have been commented out in the code and are therefore not executed.
