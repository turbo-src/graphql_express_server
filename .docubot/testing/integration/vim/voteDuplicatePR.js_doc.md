File Name: voteDuplicatePR.js

This script file is written in JavaScript and runs tests related to voting on a pull request in a repository named 'vim' using the Mocha testing framework. The main function of the script is to see if the program handles duplicate pull requests correctly.

Here are the specifics:

1. Setup: Prior to running the test case, the script creates a new repository and a new pull request using the provided test data.

2. Test Case: Tests whether the system allows reopening of a closed pull request. It specifically checks if a closed pull request can be reopened as a new one, and then closes it again after a vote, which is expected to fail. If the pull request status is still "Closed" after the vote, the test case passes.

3. Libraries: It uses several npm packages, including 'assert' for assertion in tests, 'graphql/language/parser' to parse GraphQL queries, and custom utils/requests for performing actions like creating a repo, creating a new pull request, setting a vote, and getting the status of a pull request. 

4. Snooze Function: A snooze function is used for introducing a delay of 1.5 seconds between each operation to prevent data race conditions. 

This script is part of a larger testing suite under the 'integration' directory of the 'turbosrc-service' in the filebot-store-000 app.
