File: voteTally.js

This JavaScript file focuses on testing vote casting and tallying functions under different scenarios in the 'vim' repository. The testing makes use of the Mocha framework.

The file consists of different testing scenarios, with each scenario making use of several asynchronous requests, separated by snooze() function to avoid data duplication errors due to rapid requests.

1. **postCreateRepo**: This function creates a repository. The parameters include the owner of the repo, the repo name, default hash, contributor ID, and the side (yes/no) of the vote.

2. **postNewPullRequest**: This function makes a new pull request. The parameters are the same as the postCreateRepo.

3. **postSetVote**: This function sets a vote on a pull request, again, the parameters are the same as the postCreateRepo.

4. **postGetPRvoteTotals**: This function fetches the vote totals of a pull request. The parameters are the same as the previous functions.

5. **postGetPullRequest**: This function fetches details of a pull request, the parameters are the same as before.

After each vote setting or pull request function, a snooze is induced to avoid data race conditions. Finally, different assertion checks execute to ensure that the votes are adding up as expected and that the pull request is closing when the votes exceed the decided quorum.
