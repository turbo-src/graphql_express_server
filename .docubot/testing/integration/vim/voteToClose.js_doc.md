**File:** `voteToClose.js` - This file is a test suite focused on the 'Vote to Close' function of the application.

**Contents:**

This script utilizes the Mocha testing framework for creating test cases and assertions to validate the functionality of voting to close a task or feature in a given repository.

It performs the following tasks:

1. It simulates a scenario by creating a new repository and a pull request using `postCreateRepo` and `postNewPullRequest` utility functions and by casting a vote using `postSetVote`.

2. After each operation, it allows a pause ('snooze') to avoid duplication errors or data races.

3. In the test case "Should do something", it retrieves the 'Pull Request' status using `postGetPullRequest`, checks `postGetPRvoteYesTotals` and `postGetPRvoteNoTotals` for retrieval of 'Yes' and 'No' votes respectively.

4. Finally, it verifies that the status of the pull request is closed, and that the total values for 'Yes' and 'No' votes are 0 using `assert.equal`.

This module relies heavily on asynchronous operations, and these are handled using async/await semantics. It also uses the GraphQL's Parser module to parse GraphQL queries or mutations.
