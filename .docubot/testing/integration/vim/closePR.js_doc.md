Title: closePR.js Integration Testing Documentation

The `closePR.js` file tests the functionality of closing a pull request within the `turbosrc-service` of the application. This file mainly uses Mocha as the testing framework and requires several modules to function, including assert, graphql, and several requests from the requests module.

Key Components:

1. **snooze:** This function is used to create a delay within test cases helping to prevent duplication errors with 'nodeosd'.

2. **describe('Pull requests')**: This function describes the starting test suite for the pull requests. It sets a timeout of 15000ms for the test cases within the suite to terminate if they take longer than this duration.

3. **describe.only('Close pull request.')**: This function restricts running tests only to this suite i.e., tests for closing pull requests.

4. **it("Should close pull request.")**: This is a test case which tests the ability of the service to close a pull request. A delay of 1500ms is implemented at the start to avoid data race issues. It then calls the `postClosePullRequest` function to close a pull request in 'testrepo-white' repository under the id of '7db9a'. It uses the assert module to verify whether the operation has been completed successfully.

Please note, some test cases, like creating a repository before testing and checking for duplicate PR status, are commented out in the code and can be uncommented if needed.
