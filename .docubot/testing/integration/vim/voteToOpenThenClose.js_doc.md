File: voteToOpenThenClose.js

This JavaScript file is an integration test for certain voting functionalities related to pull requests within a repository. It specifically tests the scenario of voting to keep a pull request open and then close it.

Key Functions:
1. `postCreateRepo()`: Controlled through API to create a new repository.
2. `postNewPullRequest()`: API function to create a new pull request in the created repository.
3. `postSetVote()`: API function to cast a vote on a pull request, either yes (to keep it open) or no (to close it).
4. `postGetPRvoteYesTotals()`, `postGetPRvoteNoTotals()`, `postGetPRvoteTotals()`: Fetch the total number of votes ('yes', 'no', and total).
5. `postGetPullRequest()`: Fetches the latest data/status for a particular pull request.
6. `snooze()`: A utility function to prevent multiple instances of nodeosd from clashing in terms of data handling (causing duplication errors).

The file is structured around running a core test after creating a repo and making a pull request. It checks the status of total votes, compares them against expected values, and finally checks the pull request status to ensure it transitions from "open" to "closed". The `snooze()` function is used in between operations to avoid any data handling errors. 

All these tests put together help in verifying whether the voting process for pull requests operates as expected.
