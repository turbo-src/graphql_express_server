The `server.js` file sets up an Express GraphQL API server that interacts with a voting system for pull requests. 

Key features include:
1. Reading configuration from a file to get a GitHub username.
2. Building a GraphQL schema that defines multiple Mutations and Queries related to Pull Requests, Users, Votes, Repositories, TransferReceipt, and others.
3. Maintaining a fake database for authorized contributors, pull requests, vote history, and namespaces.
4. Provides functionality for creating and querying (merging, closing, fetching) pull requests both locally and on GitHub, as well as creating, fetching, or authorizing users and contributors.
5. Set up of voting for pull requests, including handling voting power and transfer of voting tokens between users.
6. Endpoint operations for forking GitHub repositories, and verifying pull requests.
7. Middleware for logging GraphQL data.

Requires the following dependencies: `fs`, `express`, `express-graphql`, `graphql`, `cors`, `superagent`, and `tar`. The dependencies can be located at `require()` at the beginning of the file.
