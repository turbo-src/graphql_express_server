File: docker-compose.yml

This YAML file manages the deployment of two Docker services, namely `turbo-src-server` and `turbo-src-pfserver`, where each service is defined with its own set of configurations.  

1. `turbo-src-server` is the main application server. It's constructed from the `turbo-src-server:0.0.1` image, and listens on port 4000 both inside the Docker environment and on the host machine. Its environment variables are loaded from the `service.env` file. It mounts two volumes: the parent directory of the YML file to `/usr/src/app` in the Docker environment, and the external Docker volume `turbo-src-server-node-modules-data-volume` to `/usr/local/node_modules`. The server is launched by the `node server.js` command.

2. `turbo-src-pfserver` has the same setup as `turbo-src-server`, with the only difference being that it listens on port 4001 and is launched by the `node pullForkServer.js` command.

The `turbo-src-server-node-modules-data-volume` is an external volume and is used in both services. It is likely used to cache the Node modules directory, to speed up container start times and reduce network traffic.
